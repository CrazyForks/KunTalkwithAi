测试输入:
<think>
We are given no specific problem in the user's message. The user just said "hi". Since there is no mathematical problem to solve, I should respond with a greeting. However, the instruction says to format mathematical expressions with KaTeX. But since there are none, I can just write a normal response.

But note: the assistant is expected to be focused on math problems. So I can remind the user that I'm here to help with math.

Let's respond appropriately.

正则表达式测试:
1. <think>[\s\S]*?</think>
2. <thinking>[\s\S]*?</thinking>

问题分析:
- 正则表达式应该能匹配 <think> 标签
- 但是从图片看，标签没有被移除
- 可能是正则表达式的转义问题
